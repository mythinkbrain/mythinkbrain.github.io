                                            1950, kini tengah sulit. Padahal, perseroan pernah berjaya di era tahun 1970-an. Namun kinerja perusahaan BUMN ini terus menurun. Sampai-sampai harus mengalami kenyataan dinyatakan pailit pada 2008 dan harus Penundaan Kewajiban Pembayaran Utang (PKPU). Tak hanya dinyatakan pailit, perusahaan juga masih harus bertanggung jawab kepada 900 karyawan dan1.600 pensiunan. Kondisi tersebut menambah beban keuangan perusahaan. Sampai tahun 2016, Djakarta Lloyd tidak mempunyai aset. Namun, secara perlahan perusahaan mulai membayar PKPU sejak tahun 2019.

                                            Back to The Future
Back to the Future is a 1985 American science fiction adventure comedy film. It is directed by Robert Zemeckis, written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale and produced by Steven Spielberg. It stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and Crispin Glover. The film tells the story of Marty McFly, a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time from 1985 to 1955 in a plutonium-powered "time machine" invented by slightly mad scientist Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown. He meets his future parents in high school and accidentally attracts his future mother's romantic interest. Marty must repair the damage to history by causing his parents-to-be to fall in love. With the help of the scientist, he must find a way to return to 1985 and go back to the future.
Zemeckis and Gale wrote the script after Gale mused upon whether he would have befriended his father if they attended school together. Back to the Future was released on July 3, 1985 and became the most successful film of the year, grossing more than $383 million worldwide. It won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. Ronald Reagan quoted the film in his 1986 State of the Union Address. In 2008, the American Film Institute acknowledged the film as the 10th-best film in the science fiction genre. The film marked the beginning of a franchise, with sequels Back to the Future Parts II and III released in 1989 and 1990.</a>

                                            Tugas 2 Bahasa dan Terminologi Hukum   Dear students,  Here below is the reading intended for you to do your best in quick reading. Try to read and answer the questions quickly and let me know honestly how fast you had made.  A distinctively American architecture began with Frank Lloyd Wright, who had taken to heart the admonition that form should follow function and who thought of buildings not as separate architectural entities but as parts of an organic whole that included the land, the community, and the society. In a very real way the houses of colonial New England and some of the southern plantations had been functional, but Wright was the ﬁrst architect to make functionalism the authoritative principle for public as well as for domestic buildings. As early as 1906 he built the Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois, the ﬁrst of those churches that did so much to revolutionize ecclesiastical architecture in the United States. Thereafter he turned his genius to such miscellaneous structures as houses, schools, oﬃce buildings, and factories, among them the famous Larkin Building in Buffalo, New York, and the Johnson Wax Company building in Racine, Wisconsin.   The phrase “taken to heart” in line 1 is closest in meaning to which of the following? (A)  Taken seriously (B)  Criticized (C)  Memorized (D)  Taken offence ​</a>

                                            Dear students, Here below is the reading intended for you to do your best in quick reading. Try to read and answer the questions quickly and let me know honestly how fast you had made. A distinctively American architecture began with Frank Lloyd Wright, who had taken to heart the admonition that form should follow function and who thought of buildings not as separate architectural entities but as parts of an organic whole that included the land, the community, and the society .

                                            The business of tennis clothes has grown astoundingly in past few years. Over $250 million is spent annually on the trapping of tennis. Apparently everyone wants to look like a pro, even though 20% of the clientele has never even played the game. Manufacturers pay the stars lucrative fees for wearing their brands of clothes and wielding their racquets on center court. Chris Evert-Lloyd, for example, is rumored to have signed a five-year contract for $5 million with Ellesse, a producer of fancy, expensive tennis wear.
John McEnroe received a reported $600,000 for playing with a Dunlop racquet, $330,000 for sporting Tacchini clothes, and $100,000 for typing his Nike tennis shoes. Obviously, in a bad year, these stars would have made more as fashion models than as athletes. Not only tennis players get free clothing, but also all the people involved in the game the referees, lines people, ball boys and girls are living advertisements for tennis wear producers. Where, traditionally, conservative white clothing was required for the entire tennis coterie, changing times have seen a new vogue in tennis outfits. Flamboyant colors, designers' nameplates, geometric figures, and bold lines distinguish the new tennis togs from their predecessors.

                            4. 1950, kini tengah sulit. Padahal, perseroan pernah berjaya di era tahun 1970-an. Namun kinerja perusahaan BUMN ini terus menurun. Sampai-sampai harus mengalami kenyataan dinyatakan pailit pada 2008 dan harus Penundaan Kewajiban Pembayaran Utang (PKPU). Tak hanya dinyatakan pailit, perusahaan juga masih harus bertanggung jawab kepada 900 karyawan dan1.600 pensiunan. Kondisi tersebut menambah beban keuangan perusahaan. Sampai tahun 2016, Djakarta Lloyd tidak mempunyai aset. Namun, secara perlahan perusahaan mulai membayar PKPU sejak tahun 2019.

Pertanyaan:
1. Bagaimana mekanisme kepailitan pada perusahaan Perseroan berbentuk BUMN?</h2><br />
                        <p>Konsep kepailitan bagi BUMN tidak boleh dibedakan antara kepailitan terhadap badan hukum privat dan badan hukum publik seperti BUMN. Baik BUMN yang berbentuk Persero, maupun Perum dapat dipailitkan sebagaimana layaknya badan hukum privat dapat dipailitkan. Tidak ada masalah dalam mempailitkan suatu BUMN yang berbentuk badan hukum persero, karena memang UU Kepailitan juga tidak memberikan privilege terhadap BUMN pada umumnya (perhatikan privilege yang berlaku bagi Bank dan perusahaan efek yang dengan sendirinya berlaku mutatis mutandis bagi BUMN yang merupakan Bank dan perusahaan efek) dan oleh karenanya kepailitan BUMN harus dipandang sebagaimana kepailitan suatu Badan Hukum biasa.</p><p></p><p>Penjelasan:</p><p>Terhadap BUMN, baik berbentuk Persero maupun Perum berdasarkan ketentuan UU No. 37 Tahun 2004 tentang Kepailitan dan Penundaan Kewajiban Utang, sebagai berikut:</p><p>
</p>Permohonan pernyataan pailit diajukan kepada Ketua Pengadilan melalui Panitera. (Pasal 6 ayat 2).
Panitera menyampaikan permohonan pernyataan pailit kepada Ketua Pengadilan paling lambat 2 (dua) hari setelah tanggal permohonan didaftarkan. Dalam jangka waktu 3 (tiga) hari setelah tanggal permohonan didaftarkan, pengadilan menetapkan hari sidang.
Sidang pemeriksaan dilakukan dalam jangka waktu paling lambat 20 (dua puluh) hari setelah tanggal permohonan didaftarkan (pasal 6).
Pengadilan wajib memanggil Debitor jika permohonan pailit diajukan oleh Kreditor, Kejaksaan, Bank Indonesia, Badan Pengawas Pasar Modal atau Menteri Keuangan (Pasal 8).
Pengadilan dapat memanggil Kreditor jika pernyataan pailit diajukan oleh Debitor dan terdapat keraguan bahwa persyaratan pailit telah dipenuhi (Pasal 8).
Pemanggilan tersebut dilakukan oleh juru sita dengan surat kilat tercatat paling lama 7 hari sebelum persidangan pertama diselenggarakan (Pasal 8 ayat 2).
Putusan Pengadilan atas permohonan pailit harus dikabulkan apabila terdapat fakta terbukti bahwa persyaratan pailit telah terpenuhi dan putusan tersebut harus diucapkan paling lambat 60 (enam puluh) hari setelah didaftarkan (Pasal 8).
Putusan atas permohonan pernyataan pailit tersebut harus memuat secara lengkap pertimbangan hukum yang mendasari putusan tersebut berikut pendapat dari majelis hakim dan harus diucapkan dalam sidang yang terbuka untuk umum dan dapat dilaksanakan terlebih dahulu, sekalipun terhadap putusan tersebut ada upaya hukum (Pasal 8 ayat 7).<p><strong>Pelajari Lebih Lanjut:</strong></p><p>Pembahasan terkait <strong>contoh Kepailitan BUMN</strong> pada link https://brainly.co.id/tugas/30123252</p><p>#BelajarBersamaBrainly</p><br />

                            7. Back to The Future
Back to the Future is a 1985 American science fiction adventure comedy film. It is directed by Robert Zemeckis, written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale and produced by Steven Spielberg. It stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and Crispin Glover. The film tells the story of Marty McFly, a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time from 1985 to 1955 in a plutonium-powered "time machine" invented by slightly mad scientist Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown. He meets his future parents in high school and accidentally attracts his future mother's romantic interest. Marty must repair the damage to history by causing his parents-to-be to fall in love. With the help of the scientist, he must find a way to return to 1985 and go back to the future.
Zemeckis and Gale wrote the script after Gale mused upon whether he would have befriended his father if they attended school together. Back to the Future was released on July 3, 1985 and became the most successful film of the year, grossing more than $383 million worldwide. It won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. Ronald Reagan quoted the film in his 1986 State of the Union Address. In 2008, the American Film Institute acknowledged the film as the 10th-best film in the science fiction genre. The film marked the beginning of a franchise, with sequels Back to the Future Parts II and III released in 1989 and 1990.</h2><br />

                            22. Dear students, Here below is the reading intended for you to do your best in quick reading. Try to read and answer the questions quickly and let me know honestly how fast you had made. A distinctively American architecture began with Frank Lloyd Wright, who had taken to heart the admonition that form should follow function and who thought of buildings not as separate architectural entities but as parts of an organic whole that included the land, the community, and the society . In a very real way the houses of colonial New England and some of the southern plantations had been functional, but Wright was the ﬁrst architect to make functionalism the authoritative principle for public as well as for domestic buildings. As early as 1906 he built the Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois, the ﬁrst of those churches that did so much to revolutionize ecclesiastical architecture in the United States. Thereafter he turned his genius to such miscellaneous structures as houses, schools, oﬃce buildings, and factories, among them the famous Larkin Building in Buffalo, New York, and the Johnson Wax Company building in Racine, Wisconsin. 1. 1.	The phrase “taken to heart” in line 1 is closest in meaning to which of the following? (A)  Taken seriously (B)  Criticized (C)  Memorized (D)  Taken offence 2.	In what way did Wright’s public buildings differ from most of those built by earlier architects? (A)  They were built on a larger scale. (B)  Their materials came from the southern United States. (C)  They looked more like private homes. (D)  Their designs were based on how they would be used. 3.	The author mentions the Unity Temple because, it (A)  was Wright’s ﬁrst building (B)  inﬂuenced the architecture of subsequent churches (C)  demonstrated traditional ecclesiastical architecture (D)  was the largest church Wright ever designed 4.

Which of the following statements best reﬂects one of Frank Lloyd Wright’s architectural principles? (A)  Beautiful design is more important than utility.

                            24. The business of tennis clothes has grown astoundingly in past few years. Over $250 million is spent annually on the trapping of tennis. Apparently everyone wants to look like a pro, even though 20% of the clientele has never even played the game. Manufacturers pay the stars lucrative fees for wearing their brands of clothes and wielding their racquets on center court. Chris Evert-Lloyd, for example, is rumored to have signed a five-year contract for $5 million with Ellesse, a producer of fancy, expensive tennis wear.
John McEnroe received a reported $600,000 for playing with a Dunlop racquet, $330,000 for sporting Tacchini clothes, and $100,000 for typing his Nike tennis shoes. Obviously, in a bad year, these stars would have made more as fashion models than as athletes. Not only tennis players get free clothing, but also all the people involved in the game the referees, lines people, ball boys and girls are living advertisements for tennis wear producers. Where, traditionally, conservative white clothing was required for the entire tennis coterie, changing times have seen a new vogue in tennis outfits. Flamboyant colors, designers' nameplates, geometric figures, and bold lines distinguish the new tennis togs from their predecessors.
